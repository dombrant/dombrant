# Dominic Brant Portfolio - Version 0.2

This is the repo where I will host my personal website [dombrant.com](https://dombrant.com), mainly to network with and to show off my portfolio of front end projects.

If you have any comments or feedback, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dombrant/dombrant.com/issues). Also, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dombrant) if you would like to reach out to me.
